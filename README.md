# Memory Card Game

This website contains a grid of 6 cards, containing a pair of three hidden programming languages 
By clicking on any card, the player can see the programming language behind it, and thus he have to memorize it in order to match the 3 pairs with the least number of tries possible.
The scoring system lets the player get 10 if he fails on a maximum of two attempts, since this is a memory game not a 'test your luck' game
Every wrong attempt after the first two wrong attempts deduct 2 points from the player's score.
If the player wants to try another time, he can press on the restart button.
